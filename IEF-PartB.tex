% 
% The study of heavy flavour production in hadronic collisions is a wide and interesting subject. It provides crucial information
% for improving our understanding of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and the properties of QCD matter under different and
% extreme conditions. This project aims at performing measurement of closed- and open-flavor mesons with the LHCb

% pp collisions allow to better understand the underlying production mechanisms, involving the interplay of perturbative and
% nonperturbative QCD. Using pA collisions, we can learn about phenomena such as nuclear modifications of the parton
% distribution functions or energy loss in the nuclear media (cold matter effects). The study of AA collisions allows a
% characterisation of the hot and dense medium (QGP) that is formed; the (hot matter) phenomena that will be studied include:
% quenching, melting and regeneration of quarkonia. In this project we will focus on measurements related to the bottom
% quark, from B mesons to upsilon mesons. The simultaneous study of all three collisions systems (pp,pA,AA) is critical for
% distinguishing and quantifying the different phenomena involved. The LHCb experiment has unmatched capabilities for carrying
% out the measurements here proposed.

\subsubsection{Introduction}

% general QCD and QGP
Relativistic heavy ion collisions (HIC) are a good laboratory for the study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in nuclear matter. In particular, the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) can be studied, a phase of QCD in which, at sufficiently high temperature and energy density, quarks and gluons are no longer confined inside hadrons, as they are in ordinary matter. The universe is thought to have been in such a state for the few microseconds after the Big Bang, but it such extreme conditions can also be reproduced in the laboratory with HIC, currently at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC, Brookhaven, USA)
and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC, CERN, Europe).

% observables and quantities
Experimentally, the production of particles is compared between ``in-vacuum'' (using proton-proton collisions, \pp) and ``in-medium'' (using HIC, \AAA), with the possible presence of a QGP. A useful quantity is the nuclear modification factor, $\raa = \frac{1}{\ncoll}{N_{\AAA}}{N_{\pp}}$, comparing the particle production yield between \pp and \AAA collisions, normalised by the number of binary collisions \ncoll. A unit \raa for a given process indicates that, in this case, the \AAA collision is equivalent to independent ``in-vacuum'' \pp collisions, while a \raa smaller (larger) than 1 points to a suppression (enhancement) of this process. The \raa can be measured as a function of the particle kinematics (transverse momentum \pt, rapidity $y$), of the collision energy \sqrtsnn, or of the centrality of the collision (an experimental quantity correlated to the impact parameter and to the number of participants \npart).

% onia / in QGP
Heavy flavour (HF) mesons are one of the many available probes to this rich physics, but they are of special interest. They contain a heavy quark, charm or beauty ($Q = c$ or $b$), and can be classified into open ($Q\bar{q}$, where $q = u, d, s$ is a light quark: e.g. \D, \B mesons) and closed or hidden ($Q\bar{Q}$, also called quarkonia: e.g. \Jpsi, \psiP,  \PgUabc, $\chi_c$, $\chi_b$) heavy flavour.
The heavy quarks in HF mesons are produced early in the collisions, making them sensitive to the full evolution of the medium. Open HF mesons are affected by jet quenching and modifications of the jet fragmentation functions, as well as energy loss. Quarkonium production in \AAA can be suppressed due to melting in the QGP (because of Debye screening of the $Q\bar{Q}$ in the QGP, with a very high colour charge density), but also enhanced with statistical recombination (when originally uncorrelated $Q$ and $\bar{Q}$ meet in the QGP and form a quarkonium), the interplay between the two being complex and very \pt- and \sqrtsnn dependent.

% cold nuclear matter effects?
These effects from the QGP are however not the only ones at play in HIC. Indeed, the initial state itself is different from \pp, which can be described by nuclear modifications to the parton distribution functions (PDF). Partons and hadrons can also loose energy in cold nuclear matter (CNM). Such nuclear effects, which can mimic the effects due to the presence of QGP, can be better studied in proton-ion (\pA) collisions, in which no QGP is thought to form, including \rpa measurements (defined similarly to the \raa).

% more details about the project


At the LHC, while
ALICE is the only experiment fully dedicated to the study of HIC, the general purpose ATLAS and CMS detectors have also published a number of precise
measurements. It is only recently that the fourth LHC experiment, LHCb, originally focused on the study of particles containing b or c quarks, 
has also shown interest to this data, benefiting from the unique 
specificities of its detector, especially in terms of momentum resolution or particle identification. 

The LHCb detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector (VELO) surrounding the interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4\,\tesla\meter, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The combined tracking system provides a momentum resolution with a relative uncertainty well below 1\%, and an impact parameter
 measurement with a resolution of 20\,\micro\meter\ for charged particles with large transverse momentum (\pt). Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors. Photon, electron and hadron candidates
are identified by a calorimeter system
% consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. 
and muons by a system with multiwire proportional chambers.
% Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers.
% The trigger [38] consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter
% and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.

With the upcoming heavy-ion runs from the LHC -- \ppb collisions at the end of 2016 and \pbpb at the end of 2018 --
it is very timely to exploit the high quality data taken by LHCb. Despite the strong interest of the heavy-ion community and of the LHCb Collaboration,
the effort is only starting, lead by a few institutions, mostly European. Many probes are left unmeasured in the existing data, by lack of manpower and despite the important
information they can provide, and this project aims at covering some of such topics. They include the \rpa of \PgUabc, and the \raa of \Dz and prompt and non-prompt \Jpsi, three measurements complementary to each other but also extending the possibilities of the other LHC experiments.

% Besides, another important limitation exists at the moment in LHCb: the lack of properly optimised tracking algorithms for \pbpb collisions. 
In addition, the lack of \PbPb collisions has up to now limited the impact of LHCb to the most peripheral events, with occupancies similar to \pp collisions for which LHCb has been designed.
% The current tracking breaks down for the too high cluster occupancy in the VELO in \pbpb collisions, restricting the reconstruction to peripheral events only (more details in Section~\ref{sec:stateoftheart}).


% The applicant, thanks to his expertise with quarkonia and tracking in HIC, may perform major achievements in this context.

\subsubsection{The state of the art} \label{sec:stateoftheart}

\paragraph{\PgUabc:\ }\ 
$\Upsilon$ mesons have been extensively studied in pA and AA collisions, at RHIC and at the LHC. Individual
\PgUabc states have been measured separately in heavy-ion collisions for the first time by CMS\footnote{CMS Collaboration, Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 (2012), p. 222301. },
a result recently superseded with improved precision\footnote{CMS Collaboration, CMS-PAS-HIN-15-001, article in preparation.}, an analysis having received major contributions from the applicant. The \rpa of \PgUa has been measured by the ALICE, ATLAS and LHCb collaborations, providing information on energy loss and shadowing. However,
these measurements at $\sqrtsnn = 5.02\,\TeV$ were lacking a proper \pp reference at the same energy, being forced to use an interpolation of measurements at other
$\sqrt{s}$. The \PgUc in \ppb has also only been measured by CMS, but only through its ratio to the \PgUa: the \rpa of the \PgUc has never been directly measured to date.

\paragraph{\Jpsi:\ }\ 
\Jpsi measurements have been performed for more than 20 years in heavy-ion collisions, from the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN to RHIC and LHC. 
At these different collision energies, all measurements showed a centrality-dependent suppression
which gave hints of a modification caused by the medium. The LHC measurements, inclusive in \pt only with ALICE, also showed less
suppression than at RHIC or SPS, giving hints of $c\bar{c}$ recombination. However, since the total \Jpsi yield 
consists of prompt \Jpsi (from bound $c\bar{c}$ pairs, including heavier quarkonium decay) and non-prompt \Jpsi (coming
from the decay of open beauty), separated measurements were necessary to understand the behaviour of charmonia in the medium. 
This separation, first done in CMS (and also used by the applicant in his measurement of prompt \Jpsi and \psiP mesons in \pbpb), can be done down to 0 \pt only with ALICE (at central rapidity, in the electron channel) and LHCb (at forward rapidity, in the muon channel).
However, LHCb only has access to the most peripheral \pbpb collisions at the moment, a situation this proposal aims at improving. In addition, a lot of interest has been
raised recently regarding the low-\pt excess of \Jpsi production in very peripheral \pbpb in ALICE~\footnote{ALICE Collaboration, Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 222301.}, thought to be coming from photoproduction. The 
excellent momentum resolution of LHCb, superior to that of ALICE, could shed new light on this phenomenon.



\paragraph{\D mesons:\ }\ 
The charm production have been measured at RHIC via single
electrons from semileptonic decays and/or $\D \to \K\pi$. These measurements show a strong suppression at
high \pt related to $c$-quark energy loss, but no modification ($\raa \sim 1$ for all centrality) was observed
when integrating down to almost $0\,\GeVc$. 
% The open to close charm ratio at RHIC hence show that \Jpsi are heavily suppressed. 
At LHC, \D mesons have been measured by ALICE and CMS down to $2\,\GeVc$, where
a strong suppression is still observed, contrary to RHIC. 
% Noticeably, applying similar pT thresholds, one can align the \raa of \D mesons with the one of \Jpsi, a situation which is drastically different from RHIC.
% The question of measuring the \D mesons down to the lowest \pt becomes crucial.
% in interpreting the LHC \Jpsi suppression/enhancement. 
LHCb has measured \D mesons in \ppb collisions down to 0 \pt, with analysis techniques
that will be ported to \pbpb collisions in this project.



\paragraph{Nucleus-nucleus collisions in LHCb:\ }\ 
The LHC experiment has recorded \pbpb data for the first time in 2015. At the moment, no specific optimisation of the reconstruction of such events has been performed. 
% The current tracking algorithms cannot cope with
% the very high charged particle multiplicity in central \pbpb collisions: beyond 15\,000 clusters in the VELO, the event cannot be reliably reconstructed.
% The centrality could be determined from the energy deposited in the calorimeter, showing that this number of VELO clusters correpond to a minimum currently accessible centrality of about 50-60\% (Fig.~\ref{fig:pbpblhcb} left). Despite this fact and the lack of physics results published to date on this \pbpb data, LHCb has demonstrated its hability to reconstruct clean $\Jpsi \to \mumu$ and $\Dz \to \K\pi$ signals (Fig.~\ref{fig:pbpblhcb} right) in the peripheral \pbpb available, as well as a strong ultra-peripheral \Jpsi signal.
The \Dz and \Jpsi analyses based on these data are currently under internal review and are expected to be published in the Autumn 2016. A clear \Dz peak is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pbpblhcb} (right). Since the regular LHCb tracking algorithms optimised for \pp with minimal changes have been used in reconstructing these data, the analyses have only address events up to centralities of about 60\% (see Fig.~\ref{fig:pbpblhcb}, left). This limit correspond to about 15\,000 clusters in the VELO, value for which the tracking performance starts to become inefficient.

\end{figure}

LHCb also features a System for Measuring the Overlap with Gas (SMOG), consisting in the injection of a noble gas at very low pressure in the VELO, to measure the beam
position and profile with very high precision. It also allows for the study of the collision of the proton or Pb-ion LHC beam with the gas, in a ``fixed target'' mode.
The corresponding rich physics program, beyond the scope of this project, does not suffer from the tracking limitations exposed above, thanks to the smaller track multiplicity
at these much smaller centre-of-mass energies.


\subsubsection{Overview of the action}

The project will focus on heavy flavour measurements in heavy ion collisions with the LHCb experiment. $\Upsilon$ mesons will be measured in \pPb collisions (to be recorded at the end of 2016), with the expectation to measure the \rpa of the \PgUc meson for the first time in the forward acceptance of LHCb.
\Dz and \Jpsi mesons will also be measured in \pbpb collisions (2018 data). In the case of these charmed mesons, the contributions of prompt and non-prompt production will be distinguished, a first
down to 0 \pt in the forward acceptance of LHCb. The analysis of \pbpb data will require a significant improvement of the tracking algorithms available, so that more
central events can be reconstructed. This will also have a major impact on the LHCb heavy-ion program and open a new physics case for the experiment with the access
to central \pbpb collisions.


\subsubsection{Objectives, research methodology and approach}

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Tracking in central \pbpb events. }\ 
The first objective is to be able to reconstruct central events in LHCb. Currently the experiment is only capable of reconstructing events down to approximately 50\% centrality, due to the too high cluster multiplicity in the VELO: it misses most of the hard probe cross sections (which scales as the number of collisions \ncoll rather than the number of participants \npart). This is a major stake in the LHCb \pbpb program: if this limitation would be diminished or removed, LHCb would be able to perform the same physics program in \pbpb as the other LHC experiments, in particular the ALICE muon arm which covers a similar rapidity range. LHCb already benefits from its outstanding performance in terms of particle identification, momentum resolution and access to low \pt particles. A realistic goal would be to push the tracking up to 20\,000 VELO clusters, corresponding to about 30--40\% centrality.

In order to achieve this objective, two main paths will be followed, defined in discussion with LHCb tracking experts. The applicant will be able to benefit from his knowledge from CMS, having gone through the same kind of exercise over the past years. Indeed, he has optimised the Regional Iterative Tracking (RegIt), used to enhance the tracking efficiency in \pbpb in a region around reconstructed muons. For this, he has familiarised himself with the tracking algorithms used in CMS, and their difference between \pp and \pbpb.

First, a simplified tracking will be developed, that could be run within the reach of the available computing resources, in terms of time and memory usage. Quality cuts on the track seeds will be tightened, such as the minimum number of clusters in the VELO or in the tracking stations, or the ``ghost probability'' (a variable gauging the likelihood that a track candidate is a fake). The goal is to keep the fake rate low in the very high track multiplicity of PbPb collisions, even if that means slightly loosing in terms of track efficiency, especially at very low \pt.

Second, the information from the muon stations can be used, in different ways. Muon tracks can be used as seeds, or as a substitute to tracks from the tracker stations. Here the idea is to have a higher efficiency for muons, which have a much smaller multiplicity than charged particles in general and are used for measurements involving quarkonia, for instance. 

The applicant will work on these improvements at the same time as getting familiar with the LHCb reconstruction software. Once finalised, he will propose the inclusion of his algorithms in the official LHCb reconstruction software and perform its validation on 2015 \pbpb data and simulation.


\paragraph{\pPb data analysis: \PgUabc. }\ 
The project also involves data analysis of the \pPb data to be taken in November 2016, at $\sqrtsnn = 8\,\TeV$. The measurement of the nuclear modification factor of upsilon mesons, $\rpa (\PgUabc)$, will be performed as it is one of the high profile analyses that can be achieved. LHCb benefits from its excellent dimuon mass resolution ($\sim 0.5\%$ below 100\,\GeVc), better than any other LHC experiment (and in particular than ALICE in the same rapidity region, $\sim 1.7\%$). %73MeV at the jpsi peak
The measurement of the same quantity by LHCb with 2013 \pPb data at $\sqrtsnn = 5\,\TeV$ will serve as a baseline for this data analysis. Significant improvements will be possible. First, the collision energy of $\sqrtsnn = 8\,\TeV$ will allow to use the large \pp reference dataset available at the same centre-of-mass energy, allowing for a precise mapping of the $\Upsilon$ mesons modification without having to interpolate results at other energies as had to be done with 2013 \pPb data\footnote{LHCb Collaboration,
  %``Study of $\Upsilon$ production and cold nuclear matter effects in $p$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=5 TeV,''
  JHEP {\bf 1407} (2014) 094.
%   doi:10.1007/JHEP07(2014)094
%   [arXiv:1405.5152 [nucl-ex]].
  }.
Second, the much larger dataset (1.6\,\nbinv in 2013, 20\,\nbinv expected in 2016) will allow a much more precise measurement, including the access to the \PgUc (which \rpa has never been measured so far).


\paragraph{\pbpb data analysis: \Dz and \Jpsi. }\ 
Heavy flavour physics will also be investigated in \pbpb data, taking at the same time the opportunity to profit from the improved tracking algorithms to be developed for \pbpb as mentioned above. 

First, the nuclear modification factor of \Dz mesons will be measured, in the $\Dz \to \K^+\pi^-$. The same analysis techniques as used in \pPb\footnote{LHCb Collaboration, LHCb-CONF-2016-003.} will be adapted for \pbpb. Similar \Dz meson measurements are available from the ALICE and CMS experiments, but at central rapidity and, most of all, not down to 0 \pt, which only LHCb has the possibility to do. The absence of any \pt threshold is crucial as it gives direct access to the full cross section. The possibility to separate
prompt \Dz mesons from those coming from B meson decays will also be a key ingredient, giving access to an unambiguous measurement of the prompt \Dz as well as an access to the \raa
of B mesons.

Similarly, the \raa of \Jpsi will be measured, separately for prompt and non-prompt \Jpsi, again with a unique access to 0 \pt (ALICE has access to 0 \pt \Jpsi but cannot separate prompt from non-prompt \Jpsi; CMS can make the latter separation but with a \pt threshold of 3\,\GeVc). The experience of the applicant with \Jpsi measurements in \pbpb
in CMS will be of key importance. The non-prompt measurements from the \Dz and \Jpsi, arising from the same physics (modification of B mesons in \pbpb), will be compared. The comparison of the \raa of the \pt-inclusive prompt \Jpsi and \Dz, i.e. of hidden to open charm, is also of primary interest as recently underlined\footnote{H. Satz. In: Adv. High Energy Phys. 242918 (2013).}.

Both the \Dz and \Jpsi analyses will both be first performed using 2015 \pbpb data, re-reconstructed using the improved tracking algorithms developed in the scope of this project. They will then be published using the 2018 data, at the same collision energy but an expected two to ten times higher statistics.


\subsubsection{Originality and innovation aspects of the research programme}

The design of dedicated and specially optimised tracking algorithms for the reconstruction of \pbpb collisions with LHCb will be a major breakthrough for the LHCb experiment. This will require the development of novel experimental strategies, but the applicant will be able to base on his knowledge of the specificities of tracking for \pbpb collisions in CMS.

This optimised tracking will then be used for the measurement of \Dz and \Jpsi mesons in \pbpb data, taking advantage of the strengths of LHCb compared to other LHC experiments: access down to 0 \pt, excellent momentum resolution (sharp resonances and good signal significance over the continuous background), excellent impact parameter resolution (for separation of the prompt and non-prompt components).

The measurement of $\PgUabc$ in \ppb collisions will also benefit from these features of the LHCb detector. Besides the excellent precision of the measurement, it should present the \rpa of \PgUc for the first time, which would be crucial in disentangling CNM from QGP effects.

%  \item Other analysis... using the brand new PbPb tracking. 
% \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Gender dimension}

The applicant is male but the supervisor is female, and INFN includes about 15\% women, a number which is constantly increasing also thanks to the action of the early career and gender diversity committee recently created at LHCb. 

\subsubsection{Interdisciplinarity}

This project will open a new physics case in a LHCb, fully enabling heavy-ion physics in an experiment originally designed for b-physics.
% It relates two communities that are usually quite disconnected, focusing on in-medium QCD (heavy ion collisions) and in-vacuum standard model (proton-proton collisions).  The applicant is used to bridge the two, having worked both on Higgs and QGP physics (the latter in a multi-purpose experiment), as is the host, who has also worked in CDF and LHCb. This project will significantly enhance the physics case of the LHCb experiment (originally primarily focused on B physics) in the study of heavy ion collisions. 
In addition, there will also be the possibility to perform a phenomenology interpretation of some of the measurements performed within this project (e.g. the $\rpa(\PgUabc)$), especially given the applicant's interest in this regard. Such a study could be performed together with the applicant's past collaborators and / or with the theory group of the host institution. The Supervisor is involved in a project with the theory and ALICE  groups in Cagliari. If funded, this would lead to a new collaboration based on the study of new observables indicated by the theorists which could shed light on the very nature of QGP.

\subsubsection{Benefit for the applicant}
\label{sec:benefitapplicant}

The applicant will learn new skills regarding tracking, on top of his knowledge from CMS, for a new detector and having to develop the fundamentals of new algorithms. More generally speaking, his move to a new Collaboration, from CMS to LHCb, will require that he learns about a new environment, new software, and new detector (with a different architecture from a general purpose detector such as \DO or CMS). 

Among the specificities of LHCb, he will learn about particle identification (PID, the convener of this group is at INFN Cagliari) and its use in data analysis, e.g. for the \Dz in \pbpb analysis. 
% Indeed, the applicant has mostly worked with leptons so far (electrons and muons), and the use of identified charged hadrons for data analysis will be new to him.
This would expand the knowledge of the applicant, who has worked mainly with leptons in the past. Using identified charged hadrons for data analysis would be an important addition to his physics baggage.

% move elsewhere? following is not directly knowledge transfer
% It will be also the first time for the applicant to be settled outside France and to work for a non-French institution, an experience particularly important when working in the large international collaborations that are LHC experiments. 
He will also learn to manage his own budget within this project, in particular for travel to CERN and conferences, a situation that he will encounter repeatedly later in his career. The experience of the supervisor with managing projects, including the ERC Consolidator Grant, will be valuable in that sense.

The applicant's scientific network will also be expanded, with connections to a new experiment (LHCb) and a new institution (INFN Cagliari). In this way he will place himself at the heart of the community interested in heavy flavour measurements in heavy ion collisions at the LHC.



\subsubsection{Benefit for the host}

The applicant's knowledge about tracking from CMS, in particular for \pbpb collisions, will be very important for the host when transposed in LHCb: he has been leading the effort on the improvement of RegIt, gaining up to a factor 2 on the reconstruction efficiency for very displaced muons. His experience with working on heavy ions inside a general purpose LHC experiment will also be valuable. More generally, interactions between people from different experiments, with complementary approaches to detector algorithms and data analysis, prove to be a good way to let new ideas emerge. 

The project will also allow be beneficiary to the host's network. Besides the supervisor's strong connection with LAL Orsay, but also LLR (through Frédéric Fleuret), the applicant will keep his contacts with the CMS heavy ion groups of LLR but also other institutions. His collaboration with François Arleo, one of the authors of the energy loss model, crucial to the description of heavy flavour especially in \ppb, will also be appreciable.

The INFN at Cagliari already has a ALICE and LHCb group (the latter focusing on pp collisions). The creation of a heavy-ion pole in the LHCb group, at the interface with ALICE, with the recent arrival of GM, joined by the applicant, will extend the activities in the lab and its visibility in the heavy-ion and LHCb communities.

\subsubsection{Qualifications and experience of the supervisor(s)}

% {\tiny
% Provide information regarding the supervisor(s): the level of experience on the research topic proposed and their track record of work, including main international collaborations, as well as the level of experience in supervising researchers. Information provided should include participation in projects, publications, patents and any other relevant results.}
% 

The supervisor (Dr. Giulia Manca, GM) is an associate professor at the 
University of Cagliari associated with the INFN. After graduating with an 
analysis in neutrino physics (CHORUS experiment), she obtained her 
PhD at the University of Oxford, UK, in the CDF experiment at Fermilab,
where she worked in Electroweak physics first and Supersymmetry later
(as post-doc with the University of Liverpool, UK), becoming 
CDF SUSY convener and leading the effort of a team of young scientists
at Fermilab.
After a few months in ATLAS, in 2007 she moved to Cagliari and 
joined the LHCb experiment, where she worked on quarkonia physics, 
becoming sub-convener first and convener after of the related physics groups.
She lead several \Jpsi and \PgU analyses in \pp
collisions, and supervised several post-docs and graduate 
students both at CERN (where she spent two one-year periods
in 2010 and 2012) and at her home institution. In April 2015 she
was awarded a ERC Consolidator Grant to start a heavy ion physics 
programme at LHCb. She moved to Orsay (FR) 
where she started and coordinated a group of three post-docs and 
two senior researchers, who became the leading force of the 
heavy ion physics programme at LHCb. Under the supervisor's 
leadership, LHCb collected for the first time data in \PbPb 
collisions and explored a completely new energy by analysing
data with the ``SMOG'' fixed target setup.
The first analysis using the \PbPb dataset is currently under internal review
and it is expected to be published in Autumn 2016. 
In September 2016 the supervisor 
moved to the University of Cagliari and INFN where 
she has started a new group joining the heavy ion LHCb effort within 
the ERC project. The group, currently taking shape, will consist
of one young post-docs, two PhD students and the supervisor. The Cagliari group will work 
in constant collaboration with the Orsay group, which will remain 
under the supervision of GM (together with the senior researchers)
and regular meetings and travel will be organised between the two institutions.
The supervisor is also involved in a local project funded by the 
Sardinian administration, ``Regione Sardegna,'' to address the studies of 
polarisation of charmonium states at the ALICE and LHCb experiments
together with scientists of the ALICE and theory groups in Cagliari.
She is also the responsible of the ``INFN summer student program'' in 
Cagliari and supervised undergraduate students from the university of Cincinnati 
and UCLA selected through the program to spend three
months in Cagliari.
The supervisor is also author and co-author of more than 800 
papers published in peer-reviewed journals, more than 100 of which 
in the field of interest for the project, and has an ``H-index'' of 86.
She has tutored several Master Degree and PhD students and has
 been part or chair of several national
and international scientific committees and thesis juries.



\subsubsection{The Host}

% {\tiny
% The application must show that the experienced researcher will be well integrated within the team/institution in order that all parties gain the maximum knowledge and skills from the fellowship. The nature and the quality of the research group/environment as a whole should be outlined, together with the measures taken to integrate the researcher in the different areas of expertise, disciplines, and international networking opportunities that the host could offer. }

The research group in Cagliari
will be the perfect fit where to nicely integrate the ER, from the
personal and professional point of view. 
The LHCb Cagliari group has a long expertise in 
muons both from the hardware and software 
aspects, having among his members the Muon 
detector project leader and the convener of the 
% Particle Identification
PID LHCb group.

The new members hired on the 
ERC grant will 
first concentrate on the completion of the analysis of the 
\PbPb dataset together with the supervisor and the 
Orsay group. The current 
version of these analyses indicate that the 
poor performance of the PID and tracking algorithms at high occupancy 
(thus low centrality) is the main limitation already 
in the centrality of 60-70\%. The post-doc and one student will 
concentrate on the adaptation of the PID criteria
for muons and hadrons in the busy \PbPb environment.
In this they will benefit by the collaboration 
with the PID convener in 
Cagliari, who has great expertise in this area.
If awarded the grant, the ER will concentrate on the development of 
new tracking algorithms to perform efficiently in higher 
occupancy events together with one PhD student. LHCb being new in the 
heavy ion physics community, the experiment
will profit enormously from the experience 
of the ER who has pioneered the heavy-ion physics 
in CMS when only a few scientists started working 
in this area. 
The expertise the ER has developed in the CMS 
heavy ion community could be crucial for 
concretise the huge potential of LHCb in this 
type of physics. 

[the following should move?] %%FIXME

In the first year of the project the ER could perform studies of \PgU production with the proton-lead sample which will be collected at the end of 2016. In this respect the ER could profit from collaborating with the supervisor who has large expertise with the \PgU analysis at LHCb. Since event occupancies are expected to be lower in \pPb than in \PbPb, this sample will be the ideal complement to the existing \PbPb sample collected in 2015, as it has fewer challenges and larger statistics. The ER could work with a PhD student on this analysis, thus refining his tutoring skills which can be pivotal in reaching the maturity for a teaching position.
The analysis of the three \PgUn
states in \pPb data will 
be essential to establish the observation of 
the suppression of this state, and disentangle CNM from QGP effects.
Once tested on \pPb data, the ER will be able to 
apply the new technique to the \PbPb data.
LHCb is the 
only active experiment able to separate 
the prompt from the delayed component thanks 
to the superb performance of the VELO
detector. The capability of LHCb to go 
down to zero transverse momentum in the 
open charm studies, which has already been 
proved in the pPb dataset, would be the other 
completely unique feature of LHCb in
heavy nuclei collisions. Unfortunately, at the 
moment LHCb had to limit itself to the 
analysis of peripheral events due to the 
limitations of the tracking. Thanks to the new 
tracking strategy developed by the ER, 
LHCb would be able to 
expand the physics reach to most central 
collisions, thus being directly competitive 
with the ALICE experiment in the same 
rapidity range. The impact of the work of
the ER in this field would be enormous
for the LHCb experiment and for the  
physics community, and will contribute to 
the categorisation of the QGP.


The ER, with long-lasting experience in heavy nuclei
collisions and large collaborations, commissioning
of a new physics line, optimization and simulation, data analysis and track
reconstruction, will be the focus of the activities
of the new group and will in
in particular coordinate the 
collaboration with the 
theory group in Cagliari, thanks to his previous 
activities in this area.

[end to be moved] %%FIXME

   The experience of the other
researchers in the group will be a very important addition to the ER
education and will contribute to his development as independent
researcher. At the same time, being in an already established research
group will give the ER a better chance to pass on his previously
acquired knowledge and skills to the INFN scientific community. 
The international background of the supervisor and her 
broad physics experience will ensure that the 
ER will be inserted in a international network of 
research groups around the world.  The
Supervisor and the ER will draw together a career development plan,
with the major accomplishments expected from this research project in
light of short-term and long-term career objectives. Fortnightly
meeting will be held between the Supervisor and the ER to monitor the
advancement and define the strategy, in order to take proper actions
to fulfil the deadlines. Thanks to the INFN long-lasting tradition of
international training schools, the ER will also have the chance take
part to various kind of training courses in order to improve his
skills and know-how.  

- missing : collaboration/travel to France; the fact that by the time
the ER will arrive the ERC group will be more mature. %%FIXME

\subsection{Capacity of the researcher to reach and re-enforce a position of professional maturity in research}
\label{sec:maturity}
% {\tiny
% Applicants should demonstrate how the proposed research and training will contribute to the further professional development as an independent/mature researcher.  \\
% Describe briefly how the host will contribute to the advancement of the researcher's career. \\
% Therefore, a complete Career Development Plan should not be included in the proposal, but it is part of implementing the action in line with the European Charter for Researchers.\\}

The applicant has gained a position of expertise in several complementary areas. He has had a leading contribution to analysis of proton-antiproton data (with \DO), proton-lead and lead-lead data (with CMS), on physics topics ranging from Higgs boson searched and anomalous quartic gauge couplings (aQGC) in photon interactions to nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDF) and quarkonia. His prominent role in the CMS heavy-ion group has lead him to be appointed convener of the dilepton Physics Interest Group (PInG), counting 20 people from 7 institutions and 3 continents and gathering physicists interested in electroweak and quarkonium physics in HIC in the Collaboration.

At the same time, he has also showed interest in phenomenology, having co-signed to phenomenological papers, on aQGC and W boson production in hadronic collisions. The second article was co-signed with François Arleo, whose energy loss model for quarkonium production in HIC is one of the most predictive on the market, and Hannu Paukkunen, co-author of the most used nPDF set, EPS09. This connection could be useful in interpreting in depth upsilon production in pPb collisions, where both nPDF and energy loss are key ingredients to the modification with respect to \pp collisions.

The applicant is also responsible for muon reconstruction in HIC in CMS, having lead the effort on the improvement of RegIt. But while the algorithm was already existing in CMS, he will have to work on deep modifications of the tracking algorithms with the LHCb experiment, a great way to try and transpose CMS' approach of outside-in tracking from the muon systems and to improve his skills in this domain. He will also be recognised as the responsible and leader of this effort in LHCb, bringing a major and visible contribution to the experiment.

This project will also help the applicant strengthen his management skills, essential to his maturity in research. He will be involved in the supervision of a PhD student on the \rpa of \PgUabc. He will also have to push his \pbpb tracking in the LHCb collaboration, in discussion with the software and detector experts. At last, he will 
% have the opportunity to take part to the organisation of mini-workshops in INFN Cagliari, a new activity to him.
take a leading role in the collaboration with the theorists in Cagliari, strengthening the interdisciplinarity of the project. The applicant will also be actively involved in the organisation of a workshop, expected in 2018, an activity new to him where he could profit from the expertise of the supervisor and the host institution.

\subsection{Enhancing the potential and future career prospects of the researcher }
\label{sec:enhancement}
% {\tiny
% Explain the expected impact of the planned research and training on the career prospects of the experienced researcher after the fellowship. Which new competences will be acquired?}

This project will bring considerable new knowledge and experience to the applicant, as exposed in Sections~\ref{sec:benefitapplicant} and \ref{sec:maturity}. Besides, both quarkonium physics and tracking are in phase with the interests of the French heavy-ion community. Quarkonium production in HIC has been studied in several laboratories, in all 3 LHC experiments represented in France for HIC: ALICE, CMS and LHCb. Regarding tracking, several of the CMS experts in tracking in HIC work or have worked at LLR, and France is deeply involved in the Muon Forward Tracker upgrade for ALICE, requiring combined tracking with the muon chambers. The supervisor has started her ERC project at LAL Orsay, and keeps a tight collaboration with this group, sharing the same interests inside the LHCb heavy ion community. Thus, this project will allow the applicant to develop very valuable in view of obtaining a permanent position in France, which is the next step in his career.

% }

% The new tracking algorithms will be beneficial to the whole HIC group of LHCb, giving access to more central events. 

First, the results from the proposal will be discussed inside the Cagliari group, as well as mini-workshops at Cagliari (possibly yearly), between the theory, ALICE and LHCb groups -- the applicant will take part to the organisation of those. The results will also be spread inside the LHCb collaboration, being presented at internal meetings (tracking and heavy ion physics). The new tracking algorithms in particular will be developed, validated and advertised with the LHCb tracking experts. They could also lead to a technical publication (for a journal such as Nuclear Instrumentation Methods), describing the novel algorithms developed, to be cited in all subsequent LHCb physics publications using this new tracking. The physics results themselves will be published in high-impact journals, possibly Physical Review Letters since they involve first-time measurements. The applicant will communicate in the main conferences in the field, such as Quark Matter or Hard Probes, about the results. Given the small size of the heavy-ion group in LHCb, participation to these major conferences will be easier than in other experiments. For the same reason, the applicant will quickly gain a very high visibility, both inside the LHCb collaboration and within the heavy-ion community.

The applicant will be involved into events for communication to a general audience, already organized by the host institute. This includes outreach in schools, with the yearly organisation of master classes for high school students, on physics topics including heavy ions. Besides, a research open day is also organised every year, inviting the public to come to the laboratory and listen to seminars.

\subsection{Appropriateness of the management structure and procedures, including risk management }

% Describe the:
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item Organisation and management structure, as well as the progress monitoring mechanisms put in place, to ensure that objectives are reached;
%  \item Research and/or administrative risks that might endanger reaching the action objectives and the contingency plans to be put in place should risk occur.
% \end{itemize}

\paragraph{Project organisation and management structure: }\
The project will be primarily managed by the applicant, advised by the supervisor. The workflow is embedded in the LHCb
collaboration that has plenty of quality-control procedures. The money will be mostly used by the applicant to travel to
CERN and to conferences, at the applicant’s own choice, validated by the supervisor. As done in the past,
it can also be used to invite for short term periods contributors or helpers to the proposed objective and/or
be invested in organizing a workshop.



\paragraph{Risks that might endanger reaching project objectives: }\
The main risk concerns the exact feasibility of reconstructing in good conditions more central events than is currently being done in LHCb. However it would be acceptable to allow for a lower performance of the tracking than in \pp collisions: for instance a lower overall efficiency could be tolerated, especially at low \pt, and / or a higher fake rate. If the \pt threshold in track reconstruction had to be raised too much, the access to 0 \pt \Dz could not be possible in the most central events. It is also unclear what are the most central events that will be accessible. 

There is also the possibility, though very unlikely, that the 2018 \pbpb run would be shortened, postponed or even cancelled, because of issues with the accelerator or the detector, or any other reason. In this case, the project would focus on the analysis of 2015 \pbpb data (despite its much lower integrated luminosity than expected in 2018), already benefiting from the new tracking algorithms developed during the project.
